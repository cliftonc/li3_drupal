This is a very simple module to integrate the Lithium (http://dev.lithify.me) Framework into Drupal as a module.

You simply need to install Lithium:

	1. Download lithium from http://dev.lithify.me.
	2. Download li3_drupal plugin - lithium branch, place into the app/libraries folder.
	
	* git clone -b lithium git@github.com:cliftonc/li3_drupal.git	
	
Then configure Drupal: 

	1. Download and install li3_drupal module and install into your Drupal 7 instance. 	

	* git clone git@github.com:cliftonc/li3_drupal.git	

	2. Edit .module to point at your installation of Lithium (change paths as appropriate).
	3. Enable module.
	
What is included:
 
 * Drupal security adapter - uses the standard Auth::check and Li3 session management to interact with logged in Drupal user (very basic)
 * Routes - based on the configured sub-path
 * Drupal bootstrap to set environment (needs to be enhanced)
 
TODO: 

 * Enable li3 commands to be run from an admin page ?
 * Add Doctrine plugin (this does work - but removed to simplify initial release - want to be able to add as simple plugin).
 * .... ???
